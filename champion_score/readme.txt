There are two files in this folder which use the datasets within data for computations.
"engine.py" which conatins the scripts used, and "pipeline.py", which contains the code that produces data, and analysis
using the functions from "engine.py". In "pipeline.py" there are examples for how to use each available function with descriptions.
